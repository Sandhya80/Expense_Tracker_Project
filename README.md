# Expense_Tracker_Project
A budgeting and expense tracking app ( did refactoring with Redux Toolkit)
The app allows us to set budgets for various categories, such as food and transportation,
and track transactions in those categories. It then sums our spending in each category to
calculate the amount of money left to be spent.
